## Authentication with Chassy

In addition to any configuration options, you also must have `CHASSY_TOKEN`
defined within the environment. This is a secret value and as such should be
stored within your repository's or organization's GitHub secrets. This value is
what allows Chassy to authorize your workflow execution and prevents strangers
from executing workflows that aren't theirs. It is quite a long string encoded
in base64.

| Variable       | Description                                           |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `CHASSY_TOKEN` | Authentication token for automated workflow execution |

If `CHASSY_TOKEN` isn't defined, the action will fail to execute the workflow.

## Usage

Each of these options can be used in the `with` section when you call this
action.

| Configuration        | Description                                          | Type     |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `path`               | Fully qualified or glob path to file(s) for artifact | `string` |
| `architecture`       | Architecture of image to be uploaded                 | `string` |
| `os`                 | operating system name for compatibility tracking     | `string` |
| `os_version`         | operating system version for compatibility tracking  | `string` |
| `type`               | what is the artifact type                            | `string` |
| `classification`     | for file and archives, what is the class of artifact | `string` |
| `version`            | package version                                      | `string` |
| `partitions`         | path of image partition spec                         | `string` |
| `compression_scheme` | compression scheme for image                         | `string` |
| `raw_disk_scheme`    | raw disk scheme for image                            | `string` |

As of now, all of the configurations are required.

### Path

Path is a string pointing to one or more files. Note: It is only acceptable to
match multiple files if you are using `ARCHIVE` type and `BUNDLE`
classification.

These are examples of valid path values:

- `**/release/web`
- `**/*.zip`
- `./target/release/web`

### Architecture

Architecture indicates the cpu architecture of the uploaded artifact is
compatible with. The following list contains the accepted values for
`architecture`:

- `AMD64`
- `ARM64`
- `ARMv6`
- `ARMv7`
- `RISCV`
- `UNKNOWN`

### OS

OS specifies the name of the operating system name your artifact is compatible
with. Any string is acceptable for `os`. Here are examples:

- `ubuntu`
- `debian`
- `archlinux`

Specifying operating system allows Chassy to determine compatibility with your
machines.

### OS Version

OS version specifies the version of the operating system. It accepts any string,
but here are some examples:

- `22.04`
- `12.0`
- `2024.11.01`

### Version

Version specifies the version of the package itself. It accepts any string, but
is generally expected to be [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). This
parameter shouldn't be used when uploading an `IMAGE`.

### Type

Type specifies what type of artifact you are attempting to upload. Each type
deserves its own explanation. The accepted values are:

- `IMAGE`
- `FILE`
- `ARCHIVE`
- `FIRMWARE`

#### Image

Image is used when uploading an image for a container.

#### File

File is used to upload a single file.

#### Archive

Archive is used to upload an archive. If multiple files are found when searching
with your provided `path` value, then these values will be zipped together as a
single file.

If your path leads to a single file that happens to be a valid zip file (.zip,
.7z, .tar, .gz), then this file will simply be uploaded.

#### Firmware

Firmware represents device firmware. It is expected you only provide a single
value.

### Classification

Depending on the `type` of your artifact, the available values for
`classification` will change.

#### Image

The valid values for image are:

- `RFSIMAGE`
- `YOCTO`

#### Archive

The only valid value for archive is `BUNDLE` and thus it is optional.

#### File and Firmware

File and firmware artifacts support the following classifications:

- `EXECUTABLE`
- `CONFIG`
- `DATA`

### Partitions

Partitions is a string pointing to a partition spec file. This is only used when
uploading an image. This file can match glob patterns but should only match a
single file. It is to be a JSON file of the structure below:

```json
[
  {
    "filesystemType": "ext4",
    "mountPoint": "/",
    "name": "root",
    "size": "0G",
    "startSector": 0,
    "partitionType": "83"
  }
]
```

This array can have as many partitions as you'd like so long as they fit the
structure. All of the fields are required.

If you provide no partitions, an empty array will be assumed.

### Compression Scheme

Compression scheme is a string that specifies the compression scheme used for
the image. The accepted values are:

- `NONE`
- `ZIP`
- `TGZ`

It's important to understand that specifying a compression scheme will not
compress the image. It is simply a way to inform Chassy how the image was
compressed beforehand. We do recommend compressing your images before uploading
them because they can be quite large.

Otherwise, the default value is `NONE`.

### Raw Disk Scheme

Raw disk scheme is a string that specifies the raw disk scheme used for the
image. The accepted values are:

- `IMG`
- `ISO`

### Access

Access is a string that specifies the access level of the artifact. The accepted
values are (although it is case insensitive):

- `PUBLIC`
- `PRIVATE`

The default value is `PRIVATE`.

### Entrypoint

Entrypoint is a multi-line string specifying the entrypoint of the archive. It
is similar to a Dockerfile's `ENTRYPOINT` command. Entrypoint is required when
uploading an archive and is simply ignored otherwise.
